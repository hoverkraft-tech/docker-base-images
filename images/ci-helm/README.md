# ci-helm

A image for helm chart-testing (helm ct) with some handy tools added

- yq
- jq
- cURL
- OpenSSL
- Git

We also add some scripts to make life easier :

All the scripts are located in /usr/local/bin (which is in the shell default path)

| script    | purpose                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| helm-deps | automatically download helm dependencies in an arborescence |
